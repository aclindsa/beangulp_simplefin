This projects allows you to download and/or import banking transactions from
SimpleFin, with the goal of making it easier to download transactions to
beancount via the beangulp interface.

Getting Started:

First, create an account at https://bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin/create.
After providing billing info and logging into your financial institution(s)
there, create a new 'App'. You'll be given a "setup token" for this app.
Execute the following steps to convert that setup token into an access URL: 

% SETUP_TOKEN='your_setup_token_here'
% CLAIM_URL="$(echo "$SETUP_TOKEN" | base64 --decode)"
% ACCESS_URL=$(curl -H "Content-Length: 0" -X POST "$CLAIM_URL")
% echo $ACCESS_URL

The $ACCESS_URL will look something like
"https://username:password@beta-bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin" (where
"username" and "password" are long strings of gibberish instead). Store the
username and password in a secure place - these are the username/password you
will need to supply to the constructor of SimpleFinDownloader to download your
account transactions.

Once you have successfully connected your accounts AND created an app login on
SimpleFin, you can use the command-line (cli.py) to get the account IDs

% ./cli --access-url "${ACCESS_URL}" list-accounts

Once you have your simplefin username, password, AND account ID, you have
enough information to construct simplefin_downloader.SimpleFinDownloader to
download your transactions and simplefin_importer.Importer to import via
beangulp.
